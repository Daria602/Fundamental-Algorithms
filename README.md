# Graph Algorithms
This is repository for projects that deals with algorithms associated with graphs.

---

## Instalation
 The installation is pretty simple. Make sure you have `c++` on your device, download the `graph.cpp` and try it yourself.

## List of algorithms
* Breadth First Search

* [BFS infoarena](https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/bfs)

* Depth First Search

* [DFS infoarena](https://www.infoarena.ro/problema/dfs)
* [Biconnected components](https://infoarena.ro/problema/biconex) 

* Strongly connected components
* Topological sorting
* Critical connections
* Minimum spanning tree (APM)
* Hamiltonian cycle of minimum cost
* Bellman-Ford algorithm
* Dijkstra's algorithm using heap
* Havel-Hakimi algorithm
* Eulerian cycle
* Floyd-Warshall algorithm (royfloyd)
* Diameter of n-ary tree

## Usage
Every algorithm has a different specific input files.
Refer to the comments in the `main()` function to see what functions allow you to get the right input.
After getting the input, run the algorithm (printing output is not included).
